`automatic hiding` is a powerful icon.
# two states of the icon
## vertical
when the icon is vertical, clicking the icon makes it horizontal, and the view is hidden.
---
in this case, the view is **pinned**. other editors' sizes change accordingly.
---
## horizontal
when the icon is horizontal, there are several minimizied windows on the side bar. clicking these
minimized windows toggles them; clicking the icon makes it vertical, and minimized windows disappear
---
in this case, the view does not affect other editors' sizes. it covers the left one instead.
